## Description

BeerMe International is an app designed to provide you with a random beer suggestion based of a clients input of alcohol content and desired bitterness. This was inspired by the need to find a new beer without having the benifit of suggestions from social situations during times of social distancing and fewer opportunities to eat out. This was also the first group exercise in a 3 month boot camp program. It was a great example of hoe to work together on a shared repository as well as general teamwork we will have to do remotely once entering the career field.
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Usage

Useage is simple and fairly straight forward. Once you have navigated to the website (https://tjcourey.github.io/beerMe-international/) via computer or mobile device, you can select the alcohol content and bitterness via sliders and search for a beer. Alternatively you can select a completely random beer. Once you have searched for a beer it will be displayed to the page along with some information from the brewer as well as a fun way to order the beer.
